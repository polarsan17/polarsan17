### About me

I'm Jordi Genaró Solé, a high-school student (2nd year of Batxillerat) from Catalonia, diving into electronics, programming and IoT almost every day.  

I don't consider myself a "real" programmer yet — most of my code is born with the help of AI tools that I guide and debug. But that's exactly how I'm learning fast: asking good questions, understanding the output, tweaking it, and shipping working prototypes.

Right now my main focus is **making hardware + software talk nicely**, especially with microcontrollers like the ESP32. I also enjoy setting up basic Docker containers to keep projects clean and reproducible.

- 🌱 Currently building: an intelligent greenhouse controller (temp, humidity, light, automated watering & ventilation + remote dashboard)  
- ⚡ Always experimenting: sensors, actuators, Wi-Fi, cloud integration  
- 🐳 Comfortable with: basic Docker (images, containers, docker-compose)  
- 🔧 Tools I reach for daily: PlatformIO, VS Code, Blynk, AI assistants  

One project so far, but it's growing:

### What I'm learning / want to explore next

- Deeper ESP32 & FreeRTOS  
- Better sensor fusion & basic control loops  
- MQTT instead of only Blynk  
- Simple web dashboards (maybe Node-RED or Grafana)  
- Packaging projects with Docker for easier deployment  
- Maybe a bit of Rust for embedded in the future?  

Open to ideas and feedback — feel free to open an issue or discussion in any repo!
